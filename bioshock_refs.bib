abstract = {North American triple reassortant swine (TRS) influenza A viruses have caused sporadic human infections since 2005, but human-to-human transmission has not been documented. These viruses have six gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, and NS) closely related to those of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses. Therefore, understanding of these viruses' pathogenicity and transmissibility may help to identify determinants of virulence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses and to elucidate potential human health threats posed by the TRS viruses. Here we evaluated in a ferret model the pathogenicity and transmissibility of three groups of North American TRS viruses containing swine-like and/or human-like HA and NA gene segments. The study was designed only to detect informative and significant patterns in the transmissibility and pathogenicity of these three groups of viruses. We observed that irrespective of their HA and NA lineages, the TRS viruses were moderately pathogenic in ferrets and grew efficiently in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. All North American TRS viruses studied were transmitted between ferrets via direct contact. However, their transmissibility by respiratory droplets was related to their HA and NA lineages: TRS viruses with human-like HA and NA were transmitted most efficiently, those with swine-like HA and NA were transmitted minimally or not transmitted, and those with swine-like HA and human-like NA (N2) showed intermediate transmissibility. We conclude that the lineages of HA and NA may play a crucial role in the respiratory droplet transmissibility of these viruses. These findings have important implications for pandemic planning and warrant confirmation.},

abstract = {The hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay is the primary measurement used for identifying antigenically novel influenza virus strains. HAI assays measure the amount of reference sera required to prevent virus binding to red blood cells. Receptor binding avidities of viral strains are not usually taken into account when interpreting these assays. Here, we created antigenic maps of human H3N2 viruses that computationally account for variation in viral receptor binding avidities. These new antigenic maps differ qualitatively from conventional antigenic maps based on HAI measurements alone. We experimentally focused on an antigenic cluster associated with a single N145K hemagglutinin (HA) substitution that occurred between 1992 and 1995. Reverse-genetics experiments demonstrated that the N145K HA mutation increases viral receptor binding avidity. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) revealed that the N145K HA mutation does not prevent antibody binding; rather, viruses possessing this mutation escape antisera in HAI assays simply by attaching to cells more efficiently. Unexpectedly, we found an asymmetric antigenic effect of the N145K HA mutation. Once H3N2 viruses acquired K145, an epitope involving amino acid 145 became antigenically dominant. Antisera raised against an H3N2 strain possessing K145 had reduced reactivity to H3N2 strains possessing N145. Thus, individual mutations in HA can influence antigenic groupings of strains by altering receptor binding avidity and by changing the dominance of antibody responses. Our results indicate that it will be important to account for variation in viral receptor binding avidity when performing antigenic analyses in order to identify genuine antigenic differences among influenza virus variants.},

While it has been shown that acquisition of the neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M) gene segments from a Eurasian-lineage swine virus was required for airborne transmission of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus (H1N1pdm09), we show here that an arginine to lysine change in the hemagglutinin (HA) was also necessary. This change at position 149 was distal to the receptor binding site but affected virus-receptor affinity and HA dynamics, allowing the virus to replicate more efficiently in nasal turbinate epithelium and subsequently transmit between ferrets. Receptor affinity should be considered as a factor limiting swine virus spread in humans.},

abstract = {The H1N1 Eurasian avian-like swine (EAsw) influenza viruses originated from an avian H1N1 virus. To characterize potential changes in the membrane fusion activity of the hemagglutinin (HA) during avian-to-swine adaptation of the virus, we studied EAsw viruses isolated in the first years of their circulation in pigs and closely related contemporary H1N1 viruses of wild aquatic birds. Compared to the avian viruses, the swine viruses were less sensitive to neutralization by lysosomotropic agent NH 4 Cl in MDCK cells, had a higher pH optimum of hemolytic activity, and were less stable at acidic pH. Eight amino acid substitutions in the HA were found to separate the EAsw viruses from their putative avian precursor; four substitutions—T49 2 S, N72 2 D, R75 2 K, and S113 2 F—were located in the structural regions of the HA2 subunit known to play a role in acid-induced conformational transition of the HA. We also studied low-pH-induced syncytium formation by cell-expressed HA proteins and found that the HAs of the 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 pandemic viruses required a lower pH for fusion induction than did the HA of a represen-tative EAsw virus. Our data show that transmission of an avian H1N1 virus to pigs was accompanied by changes in conforma-tional stability and fusion promotion activity of the HA. We conclude that distinctive host-determined fusion characteristics of the HA may represent a barrier for avian-to-swine and swine-to-human transmission of influenza viruses. IMPORTANCE},

abstract = {Influenza A H3N2 virus caused 1968 Hong Kong influenza pandemic, and has since been one of the most prevalent seasonal influenza viruses in global populations, representing a credible pandemic candidate in future. Previous studies have established that the hemagglutinin (HA) protein is the predominant antigen and executes receptor binding and membrane fusion. Homologous sequence analysis of all HA subtypes of influenza viruses revealed that two cysteine residues (540 and 544) are uniquely present in the transmembrane domain (TM) of HA proteins from all influenza A H3N2 viruses. However, the functions of these two cysteines have not been fully studied. Here, we generated three mutants (C540S, C544L, and 2C/SL) to investigate the effects of the two TM cysteines on the biological functions of H3 HA. We herein presented evidences that the mutations of one or two of the cysteines did not affect the proper expressions of HA proteins in cells, and more importantly all mutant H3 HAs showed decreased thermal stability but increased fusion activity in comparison with wildtype HA. Our results taken together demonstrated that the two TM cysteines are important for the biological functions of H3 HA proteins.},

These sites have been located by the identification of changed amino acid residues in mutant viruses that are antigenically altered at each site. Comparison of the antigenic features with the three-dimensional structure of the H3 subtype hemagglutinin shows that the antigenic sites correspond to four topographically distinct regions of the surface of the protein. One of the sites is formed when two regions that are widely separated in the hemagglutinin monomer associate in the assembled trimer. The location of the sites relative to those proposed for the H3 subtype hemagglutinin suggests that carbohydrate modulates the antigenicity of specific regions of the hemagglutinin. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

abstract = {The scientific understanding of the driving factors behind zoonotic and pandemic influenzas is hampered by complex interactions between viruses, animal hosts and humans. This complexity makes identifying influenza viruses of high zoonotic or pandemic risk, before they emerge from animal populations, extremely difficult and uncertain. As a first step towards assessing zoonotic risk of influenza, we demonstrate a risk assessment framework to assess the relative likelihood of influenza A viruses, circulating in animal populations, making the species jump into humans. The intention is that such a risk assessment framework could assist decision-makers to compare multiple influenza viruses for zoonotic potential and hence to develop appropriate strain-specific control measures. It also provides a first step towards showing proof of principle for an eventual pandemic risk model. We show that the spatial and temporal epidemiology is as important in assessing the risk of an influenza A species jump as understanding the innate molecular capability of the virus. We also demonstrate data deficiencies that need to be addressed in order to consistently combine both epidemiological and molecular virology data into a risk assessment framework.},

abstract = {To locate antigenic epitopes on the N8 neuraminidase (NA), we generated a panel of 97 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), 66 of which inhibited NA activity (NI antibodies). Three groups of NI MAbs were identified from their different reactivities with escape mutants. Group 1 antibodies recognized the peptide loop containing residues 344 to 346, which appears to be an immunodominant region on the rim of the enzyme center of the N8 NA. Group 2 antibodies recognized a novel epitope containing residues 150, 199, 367, 399, and 400 (N2 numbering). From the location of these residues on the three-dimensional structure of the N8 NA, the epitope appears to be located at the interface of two adjacent monomers in the tetrameric NA, one contributing residues 150 and 199 and the other contributing residues 367 and 399 to 400. The available evidence indicates that the MAbs of this group react with the NA only after it is fully assembled. The third group of antibodies recognized the peptide loops containing residues 367 and 399 to 400. All of the amino acid substitutions in N8 escape mutants which affect the NI activity of antibodies were located in the peptide loops known to form epitopes in the N2 and N9 subtypes, indicating that antigenic regions in the NA head inducing NI antibodies appear to be similar among different subtypes of influenza A viruses. The MAbs used in this study will be valuable in studying the role of each N8 NA epitope in host immune defense systems and in the kinetics analysis of the biosynthesis of the enzyme.},

X-7(F1) is a reassortant virus containing the NA of the early Asian (H2N2) isolate A/RI/5+/57, and the results of antigenic and sequence analysis of X-7(F1) and of variants selected with monoclonal antibodies have been combined with a similar analysis of the A/Tokyo/3/67 NA (H2N2, M.

Most of the changes in the variants selected with monoclonal antibodies occur in those parts of the polypeptide chain which encircle the enzyme active site pocket in the three-dimensional structure (P.

The results suggest that in general the antibody binds to a site on the NA which includes those amino acid side chains which are altered in monoclonal variants.

Since then, we have generated and evaluated additional H1N1pdm vaccine candidates from viruses isolated in 2010 and 2011. The 2010 strains with the new HA substitutions near the HA receptor binding site (N125D and D127E or D127E and K209E) grew well in eggs and formed large plaques in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Introduction of these acidic amino acids into the HA of CA/09 also improved vaccine virus growth in eggs to a titer comparable to that of CA/09 LAIV. However, the high growth of A/Gilroy/231/2011 (Gil/11) vaccine virus required modification in both the HA and the NA segments. The residue at position 369 of the NA was found to be critical for virus replication in MDCK cells and eggs. These HA and NA residues had minimal impact on viral entry but greatly improved viral release from infected cells. Our data implied that the HA receptor binding and NA receptor cleaving function of the poor-growth H1N1pdm virus was not well balanced for virus replication in host cells. The high-growth vaccine candidates described in this study maintained vaccine virus antigenicity and induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies in immunized ferrets, making them suitable for vaccine production. The identification of the amino acids and their roles in viral replication should greatly help vaccine manufacturers to produce high-yield reassortant vaccine viruses against the future drifted H1N1pdm viruses.},

abstract = {The glycoprotein HA (haemagglutinin) on the surface of influenza A virus plays a central role in recognition and binding to specific host cell-surface glycan receptors and in fusion of viral membrane to the host nuclear membrane during viral replication. Given the abundance of HA on the viral surface, this protein is also the primary target for host innate and adaptive immune responses. Although addition of glycosylation sites on HA are a part of viral evolution to evade the host immune responses, there are specific glycosylation sites that are conserved during most of the evolution of the virus. In the present study, it was demonstrated that one such conserved glycosylation site at Asn(91) in H1N1 HA critically governs the glycan receptor-binding specificity and hence would potentially impinge on the host adaptation of the virus.},

@article{Mair2014,
abstract = {Influenza A virus strains adopt different host specificities mainly depending on their hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Via HA, the virus binds sialic acid receptors of the host cell and, upon endocytic uptake, HA triggers fusion between the viral envelope bilayer and the endosomal membrane by a low pH-induced conformational change leading to the release of the viral genome into the host cell cytoplasm. Both functions are crucial for viral infection enabling the genesis of new progeny virus. Adaptation to different hosts in vitro was shown to require mutations within HA altering the receptor binding and/or fusion behavior of the respective virus strain. Human adapted influenza virus strains (H1N1, H3N2, H2N2) as well as recent avian influenza virus strains (H5, H7 and H9 subtypes) which gained the ability to infect humans mostly contained mutations in the receptor binding site (RBS) of HA enabling increased binding affinity of these viruses to human type ($\alpha$-2,6 linked sialic acid) receptors. Thus, the receptor binding specificity seems to be the major requirement for successful adaptation to the human host; however, the RBS is not the only determinant of host specificity. Increased binding to a certain cell type does not always correlate with infection efficiency. Furthermore, viruses carrying mutations in the RBS often resulted in reduced viral fitness and were still unable to transmit between mammals. Recently, the pH stability of HA was reported to affect the transmissibility of influenza viruses. This review summarizes recent findings on the adaptation of influenza A viruses to the human host and related amino acid substitutions resulting in altered receptor binding specificity and/or modulated fusion pH of HA. Furthermore, the role of these properties (receptor specificity and pH stability of HA) for adaptation to and transmissibility in the human host is discussed.

abstract = {Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the...},

abstract = {Influenza viruses routinely acquire mutations in antigenic sites on the globular head of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Since these antigenic sites are near the receptor binding pocket of HA, many antigenic mutations simultaneously alter the receptor binding properties of HA. We previously reported that a K165E mutation in the Sa antigenic site of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) HA is associated with secondary neuraminidase (NA) mutations that decrease NA activity. Here, using reverse genetics, we show that the K165E HA mutation dramatically decreases HA binding to sialic acid receptors on cell surfaces. We sequentially passaged reverse-genetics-derived PR8 viruses with the K165E antigenic HA mutation in fertilized chicken eggs, and to our surprise, viruses with secondary NA mutations did not emerge. Instead, viruses with secondary HA mutations emerged in 3 independent passaging experiments, and each of these mutations increased HA binding to sialic acid receptors. Importantly, these compensatory HA mutations were located in the Ca antigenic site and prevented binding of Ca-specific monoclonal antibodies. Taken together, these data indicate that HA antigenic mutations that alter receptor binding avidity can be compensated for by secondary HA or NA mutations. Antigenic diversification of influenza viruses can therefore occur irrespective of direct antibody pressure, since compensatory HA mutations can be located in distinct antibody binding sites.},
